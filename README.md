# Integrated-Operational-Amplifier-Simulation
Design, numerical analysis, and SPICE simulation of a CMOS Operational Amplifier using 0.35μm technology. This project involves a custom MATLAB script for theoretical performance calculation (Gain, GBW, Slew Rate) and iterative circuit tuning in Cadence PSpice to meet specific industrial-level specifications.
